# Final Project for the Data Analytics Full Time (Jul'24) Bootcamp at Ironhack, Lisbon
## Overview
This repository contains the final project for the Data Analytics Full Time Bootcamp at Ironhack, Lisbon. The project focuses on analyzing the performance of EMEL's rotational parking system through a comprehensive data collection and analysis process. The goal was to gather, process, and analyze data to provide insights into parking usage and pricing dynamics.

## Project Structure
1. data_collection_api.ipynb
This notebook contains the implementation of a function that uses the EMEL API to collect parking data at two-minute intervals over a week. The collected data includes real-time occupancy information for various parking locations. This systematic data collection is crucial for understanding parking patterns and performance over time.

2. data_collection_web_scraping.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the process of web scraping the EMEL website to gather additional data on parking tariffs and other relevant information for 27 parking facilities. The web scraping approach ensures comprehensive data coverage, including pricing details and operational characteristics of each parking site.

3. final_code_emel.ipynb
This is the compiled and refined notebook that integrates the collected data, performs data cleaning, and conducts detailed analysis. It includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization to derive insights into parking behavior, pricing trends, and occupancy patterns. The notebook employs appropriate data analysis tools and techniques to present actionable findings.

## Presentation and Dashboard
A final presentation summarizing the analyses and conclusions of the project was created. You can view the presentation via the link below:
